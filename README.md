# ADXL320_MatLab
Visualize in 2D & 3D accelerometer values and tilt using Matlab

## Arduino
First you most load the .ino file on your board and make the connections.

## Matlab
When the program is running in the arduino board you open MatLab and you have to change the COM port according with your system configuration. Finally you run the 3D.m file and X-Y plot appear, with the turn icon you should move the visualization in order to see the three axis (X-Y-Z). The program will wait until you hit any key to start refreshing the plot. 2D.m file will show a plot window and simultaneously will save the data on workspace.
